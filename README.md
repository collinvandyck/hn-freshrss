# Project Goals

The first goal of this project is to create a firefox extension that will allow me to type in a search term and preview results in hacker news. The search should search by title and/or url of the HN submission and rank by newest first. If the results look good, the user should be able to click on a button which will save the appropriate hnrss.org feed into a freshrss instance.
